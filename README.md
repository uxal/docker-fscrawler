Dockerfile for [fscrawler](https://github.com/dadoonet/fscrawler)

Mostly inspired by elasticsearch's alpine [dockerfile](https://github.com/docker-library/elasticsearch/blob/f2e19796b765e2e448d0e8c651d51be992b56d08/5/alpine/Dockerfile)

Supported tags
- `2.2` with fscrawler version 2.2 and alpine 3.5
- `2.4` with fscrawler 2.4 and alpine 3.5
- `2.5-SNAPSHOT-ubuntu` with fscrawler `2.5-SNAPSHOT` and ubuntu 16.04 (built from dockerfile in `ubuntu` folder)

Dockerfile includes [tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki) (via [alpine 3.5](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=tesseract-ocr&branch=&repo=&arch=&maintainer=))

PS: The Ubuntu image was added because the alpine image was giving an error upon `mvn clean install`
It said that `initial heap size larger than max heap size` and I couldn't figure it out.
The alpine image was 308 MB, whereas the ubuntu image is 1.2 GB (but also includes tesseract-fra).
Probably a good idea to get the alpine image to work.

## Usage
The image is published on docker hub [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/shadiakiki1986/fscrawler/).

To run it against an elasticsearch instance served locally at port 9200,
```bash
docker run -it --rm --name my-fscrawler \
  -v <data folder>:/usr/share/fscrawler/data/:ro \
  -v <config folder>:/usr/share/fscrawler/config-mount/<project-name>:ro \
  shadiakiki1986/fscrawler \
  [CLI options]
```
where
* *data folder* is the path to the folder with the files to index
* *config folder* is the path to the host fscrawler [config dir](https://github.com/dadoonet/fscrawler#cli-options)
* if the config folder is not mounted from the host, the docker container will have an empty `config` folder, thus prompting the user for confirmation `Y/N` of creating the first project file
* *CLI options* are documented [here](https://github.com/dadoonet/fscrawler#cli-options)


## Examples

### Example 1
Using `docker-compose`, startup elasticsearch and run fscrawler on files in `test/data` every 15 minutes:

```bash
docker-compose up elasticsearch1 fscrawler
```

For the remaining examples, the default config depends on having a running elasticsearch instance on the localhost at port 9200.
Start one with:

```bash
# [Ref](https://github.com/docker-library/elasticsearch/issues/111)
sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144

docker-compose run -p 9200:9200 -d elasticsearch1
```

For the versions of the `docker-compose` file, `docker-compose`, and `docker`, check the [travis builds](https://travis-ci.org/shadiakiki1986/docker-fscrawler/)

Notice that the docker-compose `fscrawler` service is wired to wait for a healthcheck in `elasticsearch`.
In the case of a manual launch of elasticsearch:
- wait for around 15 seconds,
- or watch the logs,
- or check `http://$host:9200/_cat/health?h=status`
where you need to wait for `yellow` or `green`, depending on your application


### Example 2
To index the test files provided in this repo

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  --net="host" \
  --name my-fscrawler \
  -v $PWD/test/data/:/usr/share/fscrawler/data/:ro \
  shadiakiki1986/fscrawler
```

### Example 3
Same example above, but with `loop=1` to run it only once

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  --net="host" \
  --name my-fscrawler \
  -v $PWD/test/data/:/usr/share/fscrawler/data/:ro \
  -v $PWD/config/myjob:/usr/share/fscrawler/config-mount/myjob:ro \
  shadiakiki1986/fscrawler \
    --config_dir /usr/share/fscrawler/config \
    --loop 1 \
    --trace \
    myjob
```


## Building locally

To build the docker image
```
git clone https://github.com/shadiakiki1986/docker-fscrawler
docker build -t shadiakiki1986/fscrawler:local .
```

To test against elasticsearch locally, follow steps in `.travis.yml`


## Updating

To update `fscrawler` in this docker container:
- update the version number used in `Dockerfile`
  - also update the URL to the maven zip file to download
- try to build, e.g. `docker build -t shadiakiki1986/fscrawler:2.4 .`
- try to run
- commit, tag, push

To update the automated build on hub.docker.com
- the "latest" tag will get re-built automatically with the `push` above
- to add a new version tag, need to `build settings` and add it manually, then click `save` and `trigger`

To update `elasticsearch` in the `docker-compose` for the purpose of testing (e.g. `.travis.yml`)
- edit `build/elasticsearch/Dockerfile` by changing `FROM` image
- follow steps in `.travis.yml`


## Changelog

Version 2.4 (2017-12-27)
- update fscrawler from 2.2 to 2.4
- use `config-mount` for mounting config folder into fscrawler docker container
- update elasticsearch service from 5.1.2 to 6.1.1
  - elasticsearch 5.1.2 was not working with fscrawler 2.4 anyway because of https://github.com/dadoonet/fscrawler/issues/472
- replace git submodule of my fork of elasticsearch-docker with just `build/elasticsearch/Dockerfile`
  - the purpose of the fork was to push healthchecks into upstream, but my PR was rejected
  - fork was at https://github.com/shadiakiki1986/elasticsearch-docker
  - PR was at https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-docker/pull/27
  - argumentation at https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-docker/issues/60
  - proposed solution of just using docker-compose healthcheck would be too long in order to wait for "green" status

Version 2.2 (2017-02-22)
-  use fscrawler 2.2

LAST PUSH: 04.07.2019
